######  _Team 4 Sunday 13 oct project_

## Game Concept: Arabic Word Guess Challenge
### Overview: 
Players guess a secret word within 5 attempts. After their guesses, the system reveals the correct word, with added features to enhance gameplay.
### Key Features:

- Interactive Gameplay: Players guess a word, receiving immediate feedback on correct letters and positions after each attempt (e.g., color-coded hints: green for correct letters in the right place, yellow for correct letters in the wrong place).
- Hints System:Offer a limited number of hints per game (e.g., one hint that reveals a letter or the definition of the word) to assist players who are stuck.
- Desktop-Centric Design:Focus on a visually appealing and intuitive interface optimized for desktop users, ensuring easy navigation and interaction.

## Development Tools and Technologies:
 
- Notepad: A simple text editor for writing code or notes; useful for quick edits and basic programming tasks.

- Streamlit: An open-source app framework for building web applications quickly, especially for data science and machine learning projects.

- Python: A versatile programming language widely used for web development, data analysis, machine learning, and more.

- Replit: An online coding platform that allows you to write, run, and collaborate on code in various programming languages directly in your browser.
- GitHub: A platform for version control and collaboration, allowing developers to host and review code, manage projects, and build software together.



## Getting Started with Streamlit
##### What is Streamlit?
Streamlit is an open-source app framework that allows you to create beautiful web applications for your data projects quickly. Itâ€™s particularly popular among data scientists for its simplicity and ease of use.
#### Step 1: Installation
To get started, you need to have Python installed. Once you have Python, you can install Streamlit using pip:
```sh
pip install streamlit
```
#### Step 2: Create a Basic Streamlit App
Create a new Python file: Create a file named app.py.
Write Your First Streamlit App: Open app.py in a text editor or IDE and add the following code:

```sh
import streamlit as st
st.title("My First Streamlit App")
st.write("Welcome to my first Streamlit app!")
st.sidebar.header("User Input")
name = st.sidebar.text_input("Enter your name:")
st.write(f"Hello, {name}!")
```
#### Step 3: Run the Streamlit App
To run your Streamlit app, navigate to the directory where your app.py file is located and use the following command:
```sh
streamlit run app.py
```
This will open your default web browser and display the app.
#### Step 4: Deploying Your App
Once you're happy with your app, you can deploy it using platforms like Streamlit Sharing, Heroku, or AWS. Streamlit Sharing is the easiest way to deploy your app:
Push your code to a GitHub repository.
Go to Streamlit Sharing and sign in.
Click "New app," select your repository, and deploy!
##### Conclusion
Streamlit makes it easy to turn your Python scripts into interactive web applications with minimal effort. You can explore more widgets and features in the Streamlit documentation to enhance your apps further. Happy coding!
