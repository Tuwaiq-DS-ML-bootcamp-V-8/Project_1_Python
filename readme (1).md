# Personality Quiz Game

The Personality Quiz Game is an interactive application developed using Python and the Pygame library. The game presents a series of questions to the user, allowing them to select answers that correspond to different personality types. At the end of the quiz, the game displays the user's personality type based on theirï¿½selections.



## Main Components

- **Data Structure:**
Utilizes a list of dictionaries to store questions, options, and corresponding personality types. This structure allows easy access and management of quiz content.

- **Scoring System:**
Implements a scoring system to track the user's responses and calculate their personality type based on the answers selected.

- **Display Functions:**
Defines functions to render text and create buttons, enhancing the user interface and making it intuitive.

- **Event Handling:**
Uses a main loop to handle user interactions (e.g., mouse clicks) and navigate through questions. This includes checking for user input and updating the display accordingly.

- **Result Calculation**
Utilizes a max() function with a lambda expression to determine the personality type with the highest score at the end of the quiz.
